## Agenda
### Unfinished Business
        - N/A
### Business for Today
        - Clarify features for Backend in order to implement necessary functions
            - Sort By popup: We are sorting by recipe names, not tag names
        - Instructions should be inputed similar to how Ingredients and Tags are to be inputted
        - Recipe names need to be unique
### For Next Time
        - Discuss with Backend whether envisioned features can be implemented or not
## Decisions Made
    - Frontend will work on integration between frontend and backend after finishing layouts
    - Search Function: By exact prefix (case insensitive) of existing recipe names for both recommended and user recipe pages
    - We will only web scrap for 100 recipes, search function in recommended recipe page will not search through the API for more recipes
    - We will only support custom user tags, which will not be categorized. These tags will be in alphabetical order in the Sort By/Filter popup
    - The preloaded recommended recipes will no longer come with any tags
## Ending Time: 2:00pm
