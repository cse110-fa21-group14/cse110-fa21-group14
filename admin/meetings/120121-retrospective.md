        - Retrospective Major Takeaways Notes:
        - Mad:
          - There were too many branches, they were cluttered, the branch naming was a bit complicated
          - we should have worked on testing and ci/cd pipeline sooner, which would have helped with branching problems
          - meetings/dates were rescheduled often
          - integration process was not as efficient was anticipated
          - we didn't do mob programming from the start, which would have helped the integration mess 
        - Sad:
          - not as good communcation between the frontend and backend teams
          - did not get to use another type of server like firebase
          - branch organization
        - Glad:
          - great progress, pulled it through, great collaboration, worked smoothly, overcame challenges
          - tasks were more evenly distributed
          - didn't run into too many function implementation issues
          - weekends and breaks did not hold us back
          - we had many full group meetings
        - Actions:
          - Laurence will participate more in the nontechnical aspects of the development process 
          - Sam will meet with a member of frontend in person (TJ)  by this week.
          - Xiaoshuo will finish unit testing by end of the week.
          - Milan will continue communicating what are the final action items to be completed this week.
          - TJ will make new branches that are named with features and dates. 
          - Harsheta will reach out to team members at least once very week to continue good progress.
          - Maddie will continue to collaborate with Harini and communicate with the rest of the team to work on unit testing
          - Robin Nguyen will complete Unit Testing by Friday 12/3/2021. Will also complete anything else to help the team.
          - Kyle will plan meetings by Friday
          - Makayla will work on cleaning up the app in order to continue progress.
          - In general, we have to do more unit testing, finish our documentation, wrap up our code base along with features, bugs, etc, and anything related to pipeline.
###     For Next Time
