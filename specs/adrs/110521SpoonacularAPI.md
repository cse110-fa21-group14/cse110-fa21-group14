## Context and Problem Statement

We wanted to scrape for recipe information from the web so we could prompt recipes for the users even before they enter in their own 
recipes. 


## Considered Options

* We create recipes information by hand
* We build a web scrapping tool to search for information online
* Spoonacular API
* â€¦ <!-- numbers of options can vary -->

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Spoonarcular", because it is a powerful API that does exactly what we need it to.

There is none, this API is very useful!
