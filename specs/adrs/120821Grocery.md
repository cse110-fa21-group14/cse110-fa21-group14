# Grocery List Delete 

* Status: accepted <!-- optional -->
* Deciders: Kyle, Shawn, Laurence, Sam, Robin, Harini
* Date: 12/02/21

## Context and Problem Statement

Decision to make grocery list clear when all items clicked, similar to an actual grocery list (you would get rid of whole list when all items bought)

## Considered Options

* Remove ingrident from grocery list when being checked off
* Create delete button 
* Only clear the list when the users has selected all of the ingridents
* â€¦ <!-- numbers of options can vary -->

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Only clear the list when the users has selected all of the ingridents

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

It is very intuitive for the users, and relatively easy to implement without having to worry about delete functions seperately. 

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

Users would not be able to shorten the list until after all of the ingridents have been checked off
