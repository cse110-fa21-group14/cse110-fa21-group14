# Frontend and Backend Integration

* Status: accepted <!-- optional -->
* Deciders: Kyle, Shawn, Laurence, Sam, Robin, Harini
* Date: 12/02/21

## Context and Problem Statement

We have originally implemented a database of recommended recipes, we consider allowing users to search with the API as well. 

## Considered Options

* Only allow users to search from scraped list
* Only allow users to search from web
* Allow users to search both from scraped list and the web
* â€¦ <!-- numbers of options can vary -->

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Allow users to search both from scraped list and the web

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

User would have access to more recipes based on the keywords that they have input

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

Additional development work that would require adding front end button, and tweaking search function in backend.
