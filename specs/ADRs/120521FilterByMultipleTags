## Context and Problem Statement

Make filtering by multiple tags work in an intersection, so you would sort recipes with ONLY those tags; recipes with some or none of those tags would show
## Considered Options

* Filter only by one tag
* Filter with multiple where we show recipe with any of the tags
* Filter with multiple tags where we show recipes only with all of tags selected
* â€¦ <!-- numbers of options can vary -->

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Filter with multiple tags where we show recipes only with all of tags selected
